<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">software and other kinds of works.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">to take away your freedom to share and change the works. &nbsp;By contrast,</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">software for all its users. &nbsp;We, the Free Software Foundation, use the</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">any other work released this way by its authors. &nbsp;You can apply it to</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">your programs, too.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">price. &nbsp;Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. &nbsp;Therefore, you have</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">freedoms that you received. &nbsp;You must make sure that they, too, receive</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">or can get the source code. &nbsp;And you must show them these terms so they</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">know their rights.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">that there is no warranty for this free software. &nbsp;For both users' and</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">authors of previous versions.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">can do so. &nbsp;This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">protecting users' freedom to change the software. &nbsp;The systematic</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. &nbsp;Therefore, we</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">products. &nbsp;If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">make it effectively proprietary. &nbsp;To prevent this, the GPL assures that</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">modification follow.</span></p>

<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">works, such as semiconductor masks.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">License. &nbsp;Each licensee is addressed as "you". &nbsp;"Licensees" and</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">exact copy. &nbsp;The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">on the Program.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">computer or modifying a private copy. &nbsp;Propagation includes copying,</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">distribution (with or without modification), making available to the</span></p>

<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">parties to make or receive copies. &nbsp;Mere interaction with a user through</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. &nbsp;If</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a</span></p>

<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work</span></p>

<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">form of a work.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that</span></p>

<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">implementation is available to the public in source code form. &nbsp;A</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">control those activities. &nbsp;However, it does not include the work's</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">which are not part of the work. &nbsp;For example, Corresponding Source</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">includes interface definition files associated with source files for</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">subprograms and other parts of the work.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users</span></p>

<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11">licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could</span></p>

<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts11"> &nbsp;A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims</span></p>
